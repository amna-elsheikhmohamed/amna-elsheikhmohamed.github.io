# Hi üëã! My name is Amna, and I'm a New Intern from the Digital Experience Department

# Internship Weekly Summary

## Week 1

### Sunday
- **Team Introduction and Contract Signing**  
  The week began with an official introduction to the team and signing the internship contract.

- **Tour of the National Museum**  
  I went on an immersive tour of the National Museum to familiarize myself with the exhibits, layout, and the visitor engagement techniques currently in place.

- **Visitor Engagement Observation Sheets**  
  Completed 12 visitor engagement observation sheets by observing visitor interactions. This activity provided insights into how visitors respond to various exhibits, particularly multimedia ones, helping us gauge their engagement levels and identify areas for improvement.

### Monday
- **Visitor Feedback Survey**  
  Engaged with visitors and gathered feedback through a survey. The goal was to understand visitor opinions on the museum‚Äôs multimedia experiences.

### Tuesday & Wednesday
- **Learning Power BI for Data Analysis**  
  Dedicated time to studying Power BI, focusing on creating an analysis of the multimedia survey data, titled ‚ÄúVisitor Survey Analysis.‚Äù Through tutorials and practice, I learned how to use Power BI's basic functionalities to visualize the feedback data.

### Thursday
- **GitHub and Weekly Vlog**  
  Created a GitHub account and made a simple vlog to recap my week‚Äôs activities.

- **Report Drafting**  
  Drafted a report using the insights from the Visitor Survey Analysis conducted in Power BI.

## Lessons Learned
- From Power BI:
  - Learned how to clean and sort the data.
  - Practiced unpivoting columns.
  - Discovered silent visualization, which enhances interactivity and makes graphics more engaging.

## Challenges
- Initially unsure if the data was cleaned correctly, but received guidance from Tooba to confirm the process.
- Some visitor feedback was challenging to visualize effectively, particularly complex textual responses. This made it difficult to present insights clearly and concisely.

## Conclusion
Working with real data in Power BI has been a valuable experience, and I‚Äôm eager to further develop my skills in this tool, potentially through a dedicated course. While I have visited the museum before, being here as an intern has shifted my focus toward learning about the museum‚Äôs technologies rather than solely its historical content.
