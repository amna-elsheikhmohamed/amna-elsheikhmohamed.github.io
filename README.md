# Hi 👋! My name is Amna, and I'm a New Intern from the Digital Experience Department

## Week 1

**Sunday**  
- Joined the team and signed the contract  
- Toured the National Museum and completed 12 Engagement Observation sheets  

**Monday**  
- Engaged with visitors and gathered feedback through a survey to understand their opinions on multimedia  

**Tuesday & Wednesday**  
- Learned Power BI to analyze the Excel sheet, named “Visitor Survey Analysis”  

**Thursday**  
- Created an account on GitHub and made a simple vlog about my week  
- Wrote an overview report about the Power BI report  

**Lessons Learned**  
- From Power BI:
  - Learned how to clean and sort the data.
  - Learned how to unpivot columns.
  - Discovered silent visualization; it’s interactive and enhances graphics.

**Challenges**  
- Not entirely sure if I cleaned the data correctly.

**Conclusion**  
I'm excited to learn more about Power BI, and working with real data was very beneficial. I hope to take a course to deepen my knowledge. Visiting the museum as an intern felt different because I focused on learning the technologies in the museum rather than just the historical aspects.


**All the tools I used**
