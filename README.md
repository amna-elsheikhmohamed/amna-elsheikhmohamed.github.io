<h1 id="week1" align="center">Week 1 üå∏</h1>

### Sunday
-	The week began with an official introduction to the team and  the signing of the internship contract. 
-	Tour of the National Museum: I went on an immersive tour of the National Museum to familiarize myself with the exhibits, layout, and visitor engagement techniques currently in place.
-	Completing 12 Visitor Engagement Sheets: I observed visitor interactions and completed 12 engagement observation sheets. This activity provided insights into how visitors respond to various exhibits, particularly multimedia ones, helping us understand their engagement levels and areas for improvement.

### Monday
- Engaging with visitors and gathering feedback through surveys. This survey aimed to understand their opinions on the museum‚Äôs multimedia.

### Tuesday & Wednesday
- 	I dedicated time to studying Power BI, a powerful tool for analyzing data. My focus was on creating an analysis of the multimedia survey data, which I called the ‚ÄúVisitor Survey Analysis.‚Äù Through tutorials and practice, I learned how to use Power BI's basic functionalities to visualize feedback data.

### Thursday
- I created a GitHub account and made a simple vlog to recap my week‚Äôs activities.
-	I drafted a report using the results and insights from the Visitor Survey Analysis conducted in Power BI.

---

## Lessons Learned
- From Power BI:
  - I learn how to clean and sort the data.
  - I learn how to unpivot columns
  -  I learn about silence visualization it really cool and make the graphics more interactive


## Challenges
- 	Initially unsure if I cleaned the data correctly, but I checked with Tooba for confirmation.
- 	Some aspects of the data were challenging to visualize effectively.For example, complex visitor feedback, especially in textual responses, made it difficult to present insights clearly and concisely.

## Conclusion
I have always been eager to learn more about Power BI, so it was great to work with real data during my internship. I hope to take a course to further enhance my knowledge of it. I‚Äôve visited the museum twice before, but this time feels different because I‚Äôm focused on learning about the technologies available at the museum, rather than just the historical aspects.

<h1 id="week2" align="center">Week 2 üå∫</h1>

This week,  My supervisor assigned me to fork the Australian Center for Moving Image‚Äôs source code using Ruby and Jekyll to create an audio guide for a fictional exhibition. My main tasks involved customizing the website's design, adding audio generated with a text-to-speech tool, and utilizing multimedia elements published on the Qatar Museum website.

### Sunday
- Explore material to understand the project.
- Downloaded Ruby and Jekyll, set them up, and ran the project code.
### Monday
- Studied the code and attempted to understand its structure and logic.
- Watched tutorials about YAML to learn how it works.
- Tried modifying the website‚Äôs design.
### Tuesday 
- Tried modifying the website‚Äôs design.
- Created some content and images to add to the site.
- Explored free tools for converting text to speech in different languages.
- Add audios in different languages
- create simple Excel to compare Language and Audio Duration which I created with tools for converting text to speech in different languages such as Eleven Labs.

## Challenges
- Learning Ruby, which is a new framework for me.
- Finding it challenging to stay motivated with Ruby, as it feels old and doesn't interest me.

<h1 id="week3" align="center">Week 3 üìù</h1>

This week, I‚Äôm looking into a new platform, Getty‚Äôs Quire, to explore its capabilities in publishing an exhibition catalogue. My task involves forking existing code to create a custom publication, testing out its features, and experimenting with different formats: a downloadable PDF, an e-book, and an online version and check if it does support Arabic language.

## Challenges and Achievements
I tried to install Quire and Node on my laptop, but it didn‚Äôt work. I asked Tooba for help, but it didn‚Äôt work on her laptop either. I think there might be an issue with the platform, so I emailed their support team. They sent me some solutions, and I‚Äôll try them later and update you.

### Thursday
Today, our team visited the Arab Museum of Modern Art to explore the exhibition *Seeing Is Believing: The Art and Influence of G√©r√¥me*. We aimed to experience it from a guest‚Äôs perspective and to check the audio guide available there.

It was an amazing and entirely new experience for me‚Äîmy first time learning about Orientalism in art. I was captivated by G√©r√¥me‚Äôs realistic style; he portrayed Arab life with authenticity, capturing the essence of that time period without imposing European perspectives. His art is rich in detail and color, truly bringing history to life. I was also amazed at how well-preserved the paintings were. Despite being over 200 years old, they looked almost new, as if they had just been painted.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1be9e9ee-a138-4017-ba07-bb5355f1f3d4" alt="Processed Image" height="200" width="auto">

The first two sections of the exhibition were the most intriguing for me, especially the multimedia displays, which revealed details I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. For instance, in one of G√©r√¥me's paintings depicting prayer, he showed people in different postures. This caught my attention because, in Islam, we pray in unison, moving through the same stages together. The multimedia explanation helped me realize that G√©r√¥me likely intended to capture all the stages of prayer within a single scene.

The audio guide added an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience, offering a brief yet captivating story behind each painting. It wasn‚Äôt just informative it brought the artwork to life in a way that felt personal and engaging. With its distinctive and clear voice, the audio guide truly enhanced the exhibition, making the experience even more immersive.

<h1 id="week4" align="center">Week 4 üí´ </h1>

- My task this week is to explore different museum online collections and choose collection to analyze using Power BI. 
- I chose The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection, which contains a dataset of artists and artworks. I've attempting to visualize it.
  
## Challenges
One challenge I faced was trying to use a line chart or Gantt to visualize the birth and death dates, as well as the age of the artist, but it didn‚Äôt work for me. So, I ended up using a table instead. I think it would be cooler if it were a chart.
